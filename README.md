In this project, a single-cycle RISC-V processor on an FPGA is designed and implemented. The processor supports the basic phases of instruction execution in a single clock cycle and follows the RV32I base integer instruction set. The CPU has modules for memory access, write-back, execution, decoding, and fetching instructions. Peripherals like GPIO or UART can optionally be included to show off I/O capabilities.

RISC-V Single-Cycle Processor Design
Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a single-cycle RISC-V processor on an FPGA. The processor adheres to the RV32I base integer instruction set and supports the fundamental stages of instruction execution within a single clock cycle. The processor includes modules for instruction fetch, decode, execution, memory access, and write-back. Optionally, peripherals such as UART or GPIO can be integrated to demonstrate I/O capabilities.
